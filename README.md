# N(utrient)-P(hytoplankton)-Z(ooplankton)-D(etritus) Model
Here I build a simple one-box ecosystem model that tracks nitrate through a nutrient, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus compartment. 

The iPython (Jupyter) Notebook included goes into detail about the model structure and generates an interactive model "tuner" that is hosted [here](http://www.rileyxbrady.com/vis/NPZD-Model.html).
